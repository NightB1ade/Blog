	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>For holding various tiles/components/anything else in situations like board games, I wanted a way of having things to hand to test.</p>
	<p>Thus, I designed this to be able to quickly print to keep aside as my testers before commiting to a larger print.
		I embedded the numbers for the print into the bottom of the print itself so that after printing, I could easily remember what it is in a collection of these.</p>
	<p>Everything is controlled by the parameters in the top marked section.
