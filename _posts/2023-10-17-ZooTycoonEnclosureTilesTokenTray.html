	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Zoo Tycoon board game came with a load of enclosure tiles in the box that were loose.
		These models are token trays designed to hold them all in the space at the top of the box using the lid to keep them in.</p>
	<p>34mm wide wells, with side cutouts for easy removal.
		17mm total height to fit in the space left at the top of the box.</p>
	<p>There are 172 tiles, these trays hold 6 tiles a well, thus 29 wells are needed.
		I personally used the 2x5 trays (one of each icon layout) as I like being able to easily grab them with one hand, but Iâ€™ve also uploaded a 3x5 variant for those people who just want two trays.</p>
	<p>Thank you to Marc at Treecer for providing the icon files that were used for the well bottom cutouts.</p>
