	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I went for a 3×5+3 keyboard in the Waterfowl R2.
		My previous keymap for my Charybdis was designed to allow me to transition to this by encouraging that I didn’t use the 4<sup>th</sup> row and 6<sup>th</sup> column.
		Even so, I had to move a few keys or make them combos, e.g. escape.
		There were also new keys that I had to add in, e.g. Bluetooth controls.</p>
