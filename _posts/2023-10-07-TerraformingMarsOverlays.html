	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><a href="//boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars" target="_blank">Terraforming Mars</a> has an important player mat that has tracks to record the production and amount of a number of resources.
		Unfortunately, it is easily knocked and thus the game is affected.
		I found <a href="//www.thingiverse.com/thing:2988374" target="_blank">this overlay</a> that cleverly uses a bit of printed paper and wedges it in a well with a small grid overlay for the cubes.
		I did use a bit of PVA to ensure the grids did not pop out.
		And as of current I havenâ€™t added the photo corners yet to secure the mat to the back.</p>
