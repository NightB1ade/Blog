<div class="container">
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I basically took the keymap created by <a href="//keymapdb.com/keymaps/casuanoob/" target="_blank">casuanoob</a> for my gaming layer too.
		This being a column shifted Qwerty layout before then using some combo keys to get the missing keys.</p>
	<p>As of this point, I still have keys that I have not decided what to map to for best use.</p>
