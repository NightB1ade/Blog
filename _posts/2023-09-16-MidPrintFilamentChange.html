title: Mid-Print Filament Change

<div class="container">
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<h2>Printer Side</h2>
	<p>My investigations in how to print and get to a mid-print filament change such that I could change colour led me to have to put some more configs in the printer.
		My printer being an Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro, it runs Klipper.
		Apparently it does not natively come with support for the G-code <code>M600</code> which instructs the printer to do a filament change.
		And thus it ignores the code and continues.</p>
	<p>Reddit led me to <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2-W1aTK8xU" target="_blank">this video</a> that explains in more detail.
		Summary would be that one adds a macro into the printer configs that is then triggered when the <code>M600</code> is present.</p>
	<p>There are many more macros that the community has created.
		In my case, I have no need just yet for the rest of them.
		The GitHub is <a href="//github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/config/sample-macros.cfg" target="_blank">here</a>.
		The relevant code to add to <code>printer.cfg</code> is below (as of post date).</p>

# M600: Filament Change. This macro will pause the printer, move the
# tool to the change position, and retract the filament 50mm. Adjust
# the retraction settings for your own extruder. After filament has
# been changed, the print can be resumed from its previous position
# with the "RESUME" gcode.

[pause_resume]

[gcode_macro M600]
gcode:
	{% set X = params.X|default(50)|float %}
	{% set Y = params.Y|default(0)|float %}
	{% set Z = params.Z|default(10)|float %}
	SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=M600_state
	PAUSE

	G1 E-50 F1000
	RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=M600_state
	{% endraw %}</pre></code>


	<h2>Slicer</h2>
	<p>There are plenty of resources online, but for my printer, I have to add in post-processing commands in.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Under <code>Extensions</code> &gt; <code>Post-Processing</code> &gt; <code>Modify G-Code</code></li>
		<li>Add script of <code>Filament Change</code></li>
		<li>The main thing is to remember is that the layer change number is when it requests the filament change <em>prior</em> to printing that layer
	</ul>
	<p>Another thing to consider is that a shall purge tower is useful such that the tiny bit of built up filament on the head whilst the physical switch over of the reel is happening.
		I used a small 20mm ring of 1mm thickness to do so successfully.</p>
