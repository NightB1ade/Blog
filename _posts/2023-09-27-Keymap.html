	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>After getting my Charybdis from <a href="//bastardkb.com" target="_blank">BastardKB</a> a couple months ago, I’ve been going through various iterations of my keymap.
		I took the initial keymap that was provided, then modified it to have a <a href="{{ '/2023/08/21/TarmakDH.html' | relative_url }}">Colemak-DH</a> base and created a lot of the standard layers people have.
		I also took inspiration from a user called casuanoob’s <a href="//keymapdb.com/keymaps/casuanoob/" target="_blank">layout</a> with the brackets and some of the combo keys (and in a later post when I write it up, the gaming layer).</p>
	<p>The keymap is also designed to aid me to have some duplication such that I would be able to use a 3×6 layout (if it has a pointing device) in the future.</p>
	<p>Information on the magic keys can be found <a href="{{ '/2023/08/28/KeyboardMagicKey.html' | relative_url }}">here</a>.</p>
