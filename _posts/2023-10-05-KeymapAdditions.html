<div class="container">
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Upon further usage, I added an “=” key as a combo key on the Base layer as I found it was useful for programming activities.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I added a “_” and a “:” key to my numpad layer to be able to easily type dates and times (in specific naming conventions) respectively.</p>
