	<h1>To Me</h1>
	<p>I first heard this saying from the anime Blood+ and it stuck with me ever since.
		It gives me solace to remember that in the less good times of life, one can be okay in the future.</p>
	<p>This is borrowed from an Okinawan saying, “なんくるないさ”.</p>
	<p>More recently on an episode of <a href="//99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>, I heard an addition to the saying.
		“Eveyrthing will be alright in the end.  And if it is not alright, it is not the end.”</p>
	<p>Which to me, this reinforces the message that I already took from the first part of the saying.</p>
