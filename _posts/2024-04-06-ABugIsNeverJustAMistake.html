	<h1>To Me</h1>
	<p>I enjoy this saying.
		I actually found it whilst I was practicing on <a href="//monkeytype.com">Monkeytype</a>.
		It reminds me that however good we get at doing things like coding or anything else that requires precision and consistency, we will still always have a blind spot.
		In our learning, in our experiences, there’s going to be errors that we make.</p>
	<p>There’s two main things that this means to me.
		Firstly, owning your mistakes is important, you’ll be doing something different from the next person and it makes you, you, as the saying says.</p>
	<p>The second implication is that there’s always something to learn from others.
		Others are able to cover each other’s deficiencies.</p>
